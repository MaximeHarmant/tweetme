# TWEETME 

Enjoying with side project

# Getting Started

To get up and running, simply do the following:

    $ git clone https://github.com/MaximeHarmant/tweetme.git
    $ cd tweetme

    # Install the requirements
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

**NOTE**: We highly recommend creating a [Virtual Environment](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/).
Python Virtual Environments allow developers to work in isolated sandboxes and to create separation between python packages installed via [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip).
